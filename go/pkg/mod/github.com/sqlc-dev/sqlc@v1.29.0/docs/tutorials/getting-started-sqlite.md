# Getting started with SQLite

This tutorial assumes that the latest version of sqlc is
[installed](../overview/install.md) and ready to use.

We'll generate Go code here, but other
[language plugins](../reference/language-support.rst) are available. You'll
naturally need the Go toolchain if you want to build and run a program with the
code sqlc generates, but sqlc itself has no dependencies.

## Setting up

Create a new directory called `sqlc-tutorial` and open it up.

Initialize a new Go module named `tutorial.sqlc.dev/app`

```shell
go mod init tutorial.sqlc.dev/app
```

sqlc looks for either a `sqlc.(yaml|yml)` or `sqlc.json` file in the current
directory. In our new directory, create a file named `sqlc.yaml` with the
following contents:

```yaml
version: "2"
sql:
  - engine: "sqlite"
    queries: "query.sql"
    schema: "schema.sql"
    gen:
      go:
        package: "tutorial"
        out: "tutorial"
```

## Schema and queries

sqlc needs to know your database schema and queries in order to generate code.
In the same directory, create a file named `schema.sql` with the following
content:

```sql
CREATE TABLE authors (
  id   INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name text    NOT NULL,
  bio  text
);
```

Next, create a `query.sql` file with the following five queries:

```sql
-- name: GetAuthor :one
SELECT * FROM authors
WHERE id = ? LIMIT 1;

-- name: ListAuthors :many
SELECT * FROM authors
ORDER BY name;

-- name: CreateAuthor :one
INSERT INTO authors (
  name, bio
) VALUES (
  ?, ?
)
RETURNING *;

-- name: UpdateAuthor :exec
UPDATE authors
set name = ?,
bio = ?
WHERE id = ?;

-- name: DeleteAuthor :exec
DELETE FROM authors
WHERE id = ?;
```

If you prefer, you can alter the `UpdateAuthor` query to return the updated
record:

```sql
-- name: UpdateAuthor :one
UPDATE authors
set name = ?,
bio = ?
WHERE id = ?
RETURNING *;
```

## Generating code

You are now ready to generate code. You shouldn't see any output when you run
the `generate` subcommand, unless something goes wrong:

```shell
sqlc generate
```

You should now have a `tutorial` subdirectory with three files containing Go
source code. These files comprise a Go package named `tutorial`:

```
├── go.mod
├── query.sql
├── schema.sql
├── sqlc.yaml
└── tutorial
    ├── db.go
    ├── models.go
    └── query.sql.go
```

## Using generated code

You can use your newly-generated `tutorial` package from any Go program.
Create a file named `tutorial.go` and add the following contents:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"database/sql"
	_ "embed"
	"log"
	"reflect"

	_ "modernc.org/sqlite"

	"tutorial.sqlc.dev/app/tutorial"
)

//go:embed schema.sql
var ddl string

func run() error {
	ctx := context.Background()

	db, err := sql.Open("sqlite", ":memory:")
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	// create tables
	if _, err := db.ExecContext(ctx, ddl); err != nil {
		return err
	}

	queries := tutorial.New(db)

	// list all authors
	authors, err := queries.ListAuthors(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	log.Println(authors)

	// create an author
	insertedAuthor, err := queries.CreateAuthor(ctx, tutorial.CreateAuthorParams{
		Name: "Brian Kernighan",
		Bio:  sql.NullString{String: "Co-author of The C Programming Language and The Go Programming Language", Valid: true},
	})
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	log.Println(insertedAuthor)

	// get the author we just inserted
	fetchedAuthor, err := queries.GetAuthor(ctx, insertedAuthor.ID)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	// prints true
	log.Println(reflect.DeepEqual(insertedAuthor, fetchedAuthor))
	return nil
}

func main() {
	if err := run(); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

Before this code will compile you'll need to fetch the relevant SQLite driver:

```shell
go get modernc.org/sqlite
go build ./...
```

The program should compile without errors, and run successfully. To make that
possible, sqlc generates readable, **idiomatic** Go code that you
otherwise would've had to write yourself. Take a look in `tutorial/query.sql.go`.

You should now have a working program using sqlc's generated Go source code,
and hopefully can see how you'd use sqlc in your own real-world applications.
